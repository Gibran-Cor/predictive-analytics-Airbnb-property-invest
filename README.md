**Overview**
Welcome to the Property Price Prediction project! This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on predicting property prices using data obtained from world-data. The dataset comprises information on 76,000 properties, with 11 variables that can potentially influence their prices. The primary objective is to build a statistical model capable of predicting property prices accurately. This model aims to be a valuable tool for current hosts managing temporary rentals and individuals considering renting out their homes.

**Project Objectives**
The main goals of this project are as follows:

**Price Prediction**: Develop a statistical model that can predict the price of a property. This functionality is intended to assist both current hosts in optimizing their pricing strategy and potential hosts in estimating the rental value of their properties.

**Key Factors Analysis**: Identify and analyze key factors that significantly impact the price of a property. Understanding these factors can provide valuable insights for hosts and individuals looking to optimize their property's market value.

**Models Used**
The project employs two regression models for property price prediction:

**Ridge Regression:** Ridge regression is utilized as a regularization technique to mitigate potential overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

**Linear Regression:** Linear regression is applied to establish a baseline model for predicting property prices based on the available variables.

**Repository Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset obtained from world-data.

notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are provided in this directory for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

src: The source code for the regression models (Ridge and Linear) is stored in this directory. It includes modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

reports: This directory contains any reports, visualizations, or findings generated during the analysis.
